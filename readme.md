# This is a test page to see how Github Pages Works!

Hi! I am a complete beginner to coding and web development. I am very interested in seeing how both Github and Github Pages works and am using this project as a test page to test it's capabilities.


# Other tools

*I am looking at using Stackedit and TinyMCE to help me write the code and have started using a template in Jekyll 

## Process

I will update this Readme file to document my progress
