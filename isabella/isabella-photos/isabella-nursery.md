**Any additional information…**

**Isabella is a very independent happy baby. She is social and friendly. She has been going to the crèche for a couple of hours 3-4 times a week so I believe she will adapt nicely.**

**When she is teething she can be a bit clingy, her nose runs and she poos a lot. At all other times, she's quite ok just to get on with it.**

**She does respond to short simple commands like "Isabella no thank you" or "come here please" and we are trying to instill boundaries from a young age.**

**She seems to be quite a clever little girl with a natural curiosity and we would like this nurtured.**

**She is Christian and she goes to church every week. We do not want her to actively participate in any Halloween celebrations or be exposed to LGBT agendas.**

**Both parents do shift work so sometimes the schedule may seem like it isa bit all over the place. Whilst this isn't really ideal, it is simply our reality, so we will simply have to help her adapt the best we can.**
